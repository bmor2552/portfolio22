# Portfolio Demo 
As an upcoming developer, it is important that I build out websites and applications that showcase my skills. Within this portfolio you will find a demo of a personal website. 

# The Process 
When planning the layout, I had a certain look in mind, I wanted a landing page that would link to projects and websites outside of the landing page. In order for me to do this I needed resources:

1. Google 
2. Youtube: 
    - Traversy Media 
    - Tutorial Dev
3. Free Code Camp 
4. W3 Schools 
5. The Odin Project 

# The struggle
I struggled with the timing of everything, things I thought would take a few minutes took about 30 minutes (sometimes more). I wanted to struggle through creating the landing page before looking for the answer (through resources). 

My reasoning for this was to make sure that the basics become second nature to me. The main thing I struggled with was the css flex box, but the more I played around with it the easier it became. 

# The Conclusion
Overall, after building this landing page, I have better understanding of how the process should go and what to aim for. My planning has gotten better and so has my css flexbox! I will try this again in the near future with a more complex design (a video playing in the background for the landing page with css grid).
